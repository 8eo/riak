* Concepts

** Listeners
   
   Replication 'listener' nodes are Riak cluster nodes that will listen on an 
   external IP address and port for the purposes of handling Replication 
   requests.  Any node in a Riak cluster can participate as a listener - adding
   more nodes will increase the fault-tolerance of the replication process in 
   the presence of individual node failures.
