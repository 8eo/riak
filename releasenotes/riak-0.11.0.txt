Riak 0.11.0 Release Notes
-------------------------

Bitcask has arrive as the new default backend for Riak.  Bitcask is Basho's
new key/value store that should provide good balanced performance out
of the box on most systems.  Read more about it from the initial
announcement here http://blog.basho.com/2010/04/27/hello,-bitcask/

Users that wish to upgrade from another backend will need to backup their
cluster (using riak-admin) before changing the backend in app.config, restart 
riak and restore from the backup into bitcask.

The protocol buffers client (PBC) interface has been enhanced to 
add map/reduce support and access to simple bucket properties.  The
erlang and python clients have been updated accordingly.

Put operations using the local erlang client that rqeuest a returnbody
have received an performance enhancement.  Internally the put operation
now returns the body directly rather so an additional get is no longer 
required.  The PBC and HTTP interfaces have been updated to use
the new mechanism.
